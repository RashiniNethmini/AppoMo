## Appointment Management System
### Introduction

An appointment management system is a digital solution used by companies and service providers to streamline their service appointments. Most frequently it is a web-based system, which at times comes along with a mobile application, through which citizens can book, schedule or cancel appointments. 

Appomo is a booking system with a mobile and web application designed exclusively for electronic device repair companies. Customers can submit their  electric/electronic equipment issues and schedule appointments through the mobile app, which consists of a  B2C marketplace-like interface for customers to browse different service providers. Service providers use the web app to view, accept, or reject issues and manage appointments. The appointment is placed only after the service provider acknowledges the issue and confirms that the product can be fixed. Moreover, CAAS and SMS APIs from Ideamart are integrated to enable advance payment and SMS notifications respectively.

# Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly mobile app for managing appointment scheduling.
- Enable SMS-based communication with per-message-based charging.
- Implement efficient methods for data upload, update, and display.
- Integrate the system with existing calendars to facilitate appointment bookings and coordination.
- Allow users to book appointments anytime and from anywhere, providing easy access to available time slots.
- Provide automated reminders and follow-ups as the booking date approaches.
- Enable rescheduling and filling of canceled appointments.
